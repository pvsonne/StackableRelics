# StackableRelics
A mod that makes relics in Peglin stackable, and allows you to choose up to 3 relics that you will see in-game.
## How-To
Once installed, the settings menu should have 4 new options at the bottom (Credit to Rwarazor for their code) that allow you to input the relics you want. The first option determines if the relics appear randomly, or in a consistent order. The 3 next options are spaces for you to type in the EXACT ENGLISH NAME of the relics you want. Capitalization does matter. Otherwise, game will softlock. As for Pumpkin π, <-- copy and paste that right there. Leave the options empty if you only want 1 or 2 relics to appear.
## IMPORTANT
If your game crashes, or you quit and exit, or anything that leaves the gameplay and either returns to the main menu or exits completely, uhhh, good luck. You very well might lose all your progress, or maybe everything will be fine. So don't do that. If that does happen, your odds of saving your progress are better if you fully restart the game then hit continue, than just hitting continue from the get-go. I also do not guarantee whether this mod works with others or not.
